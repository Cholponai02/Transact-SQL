# Interesting T-SQL Functions and Features for MS SQL Server

---

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository contains a collection of interesting functions and features you can implement using T-SQL in Microsoft SQL Server.

Here, you'll find creative, practical, and versatile solutions to handle tasks such as string processing, date manipulation, generating random data, and more.

## ðŸ“‹ What Youâ€™ll Find in This Project:

### 1. String Manipulation
- **String Splitting**: A `SplitString` function to convert a delimited string into a tabular format.  
- **Word Count**: A simple way to count the number of words in a text.  

### 2. Numeric Operations
- **Palindrome Check**: Determine if a given string or number is a palindrome.  

### 3. Date and Time Functions
- **Date Difference in Human-Readable Format**: Calculate the difference between two dates as "years, months, and days."  

### 4. Data Generation
- **Random Password Generator**: Create secure and unique passwords using T-SQL.  

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements:
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Supports SQL Server 2016 and newer versions.  
- **Database Access**: Ensure you have permissions to create functions (`CREATE FUNCTION`) and execute queries.  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use:
1. Copy the desired function or script from the repository.  
2. Run the SQL script in your database.  
3. Use the function in your queries or applications.  

### Example:
To split a string like "123,456,789" into individual values:
```sql
SELECT * FROM dbo.SplitString('123,456,789', ',');
```
## ðŸ§  Why This Is Useful:
- Simplifies complex queries, making code cleaner and easier to read.  
- Automates repetitive tasks efficiently.  
- Leverages built-in SQL Server capabilities to improve performance.
